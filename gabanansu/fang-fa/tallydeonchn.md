This guide describes how to cast a vote on a proposal (on-chain) created on Tally.

### Step-by-step

⚠️ _You CANNOT vote if you have not delegated your token., You have to either delegate your token power to yourself or a delegate in order to vote in governance. Self-delegate or delegate to others_ [_here_](https://app.euler.finance/delegates)_._

2\. Click on an active proposal of your choice.

3\. Click on `Vote`
